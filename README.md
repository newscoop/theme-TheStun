The Stun
========

'The Stun' is a theme for online newspapers, intended to work with the <a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/newscoop/">Newscoop</a> content management system from <a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/">Sourcefabric</a>. It was designed by Peter Bradley.

This theme is meant to be as simple as possible. It contains just two CSS files and the bare minimum of features needed to display the front page, sections and articles. The idea is to make it easier for new designers to learn how a Newscoop theme works, compared to them looking at the code of full-feature themes. It also contains an
example of how to use a web font from http://www.fontsquirrel.com/ in a Newscoop theme.
